# Creating Advertisement Video Using Neural Models / Tvorba reklamního videa pomocí neuronových modelů

The aim of this work is to create a system for the automatic generation of advertising videos based on textual descriptions, which will help users without video production experience save time and money. The work consists of two main parts. The first part uses generative models Stable Diffusion and Stable Video Diffusion for the creation of visual content and GPT-3.5 Turbo for creating scripts for advertising videos. The second part is a web application that allows users to input the necessary information for advertisements and to display the finished videos. This system simplifies and accelerates the process of creating various types of advertisements.
